# Thinking ...

Okay, I need to understand this codebase. Let's start by looking at the README. It says this is a sample .NET Core REST API using CQRS with raw SQL and DDD following Clean Architecture. The architecture diagram shows layers like Application, Domain, Infrastructure, and API.

First, I'll check the solution structure. The solution has projects: API, Application, Domain, Infrastructure, and test projects. The Domain project has entities like Customer, Order, Product, and value objects like MoneyValue. The Application project contains commands, queries, and handlers. The Infrastructure handles data access with Entity Framework and raw SQL via Dapper, and things like caching and email.

Looking at the CustomersController in the API project, it uses MediatR to send commands. For example, the RegisterCustomerCommand is handled by RegisterCustomerCommandHandler in the Application layer. The handler uses a CustomerRepository and checks uniqueness via ICustomerUniquenessChecker, which is implemented in Infrastructure using Dapper to query the database.

The Domain project has aggregates like Customer, which enforces business rules. For example, the Customer.CreateRegistered method checks the CustomerEmailMustBeUniqueRule. The Application layer uses FluentValidation for command validation, like in PlaceCustomerOrderCommandValidator.

The Infrastructure project sets up the database with EF Core, but uses Dapper for read operations. The OrdersContext is configured with various entity configurations. The Outbox pattern is implemented with Quartz jobs to process messages, ensuring reliable messaging.

Caching is handled with an in-memory cache using Cache-Aside pattern. The CachingModule in Infrastructure registers the cache store. The EmailModule uses a dummy email sender, which can be replaced with a real implementation.

Testing is done with Integration and Unit tests. Integration tests use a real database and check if commands and queries work as expected, while unit tests focus on domain logic and rules.

The CI/CD pipeline is set up with GitHub Actions, building and testing on push or pull requests to master.

Key things to note: The separation of read and write models in CQRS. Commands modify the state using Domain models and EF Core, while queries use Dapper to fetch data from views. Domain events are used to handle side effects, like sending emails or creating payments.

Potential improvements: The email sender is a placeholder; integrating a real service would be needed. More validation and error handling could be added. Also, the caching implementation is basic and might need more sophisticated strategies.

Overall, the structure follows Clean Architecture principles, with clear separation of concerns and dependency inversion. The use of MediatR for CQRS and domain events helps in keeping the code organized and decoupled.

This .NET Core REST API exemplifies CQRS and DDD using Clean Architecture. Here's a concise breakdown:

# Overview

This .NET Core REST API exemplifies CQRS and DDD using Clean Architecture. Here's a concise breakdown:

**Architecture Layers**
1. **Domain**  
   - Contains aggregates (`Customer`, `Order`), value objects (`MoneyValue`), domain services, and business rules.  
   - Enforces invariants (e.g., `CustomerEmailMustBeUniqueRule`).

2. **Application**  
   - MediatR commands/queries (e.g., `RegisterCustomerCommand`, `GetCustomerOrdersQuery`).  
   - Validation with FluentValidation.  
   - Interfaces for domain services (e.g., `ICustomerUniquenessChecker`).

3. **Infrastructure**  
   - Implements persistence with EF Core (write model) and Dapper (read model via SQL views).  
   - Outbox pattern (Quartz.NET) for reliable messaging.  
   - Caching (Cache-Aside), logging, and email services.

4. **API**  
   - REST endpoints using MediatR to dispatch commands/queries.  
   - ProblemDetails for standardized error responses.

**Key Features**
- **CQRS Separation**:  
  - **Commands** (e.g., `PlaceCustomerOrderCommand`) modify state, using EF Core and domain models.  
  - **Queries** (e.g., `GetCustomerOrdersQuery`) fetch data via Dapper from optimized SQL views.

- **Domain Events & Integration**:  
  - Events like `OrderPlacedEvent` trigger handlers (e.g., create payment, send email).  
  - Outbox ensures reliable event processing.

- **Validation**:  
  - **Input Validation**: FluentValidation in Application layer.  
  - **Business Rules**: Enforced in Domain layer (e.g., `CustomerCannotOrderMoreThan2OrdersOnTheSameDayRule`).

**Infrastructure**
- **EF Core**: Configures aggregates with owned types and value converters.  
- **Dapper**: Raw SQL for queries, mapping directly to DTOs.  
- **Caching**: `MemoryCacheStore` with Cache-Aside pattern.  
- **Quartz.NET**: Processes outbox messages and internal commands periodically.

**Testing**
- **Unit Tests**: Verify domain logic (e.g., business rules, value objects).  
- **Integration Tests**: Test full flow with real database, checking commands, queries, and domain events.

**Improvements & Considerations**
- **Real Email Service**: Replace `EmailSender` mock with SMTP or third-party service.  
- **Advanced Caching**: Consider Redis for distributed scenarios.  
- **Enhanced Security**: Add authentication/authorization.  
- **Logging/Monitoring**: Integrate with tools like Application Insights.

**CI/CD**: GitHub Actions build and test on PRs/master.

This structure promotes separation of concerns, testability, and scalability, adhering to Clean Architecture and DDD principles.
